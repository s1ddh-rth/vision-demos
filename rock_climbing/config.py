# Slack on the mask edge, normalized. Two thresholds, not one, because getting

# second — which would shred the contact into fragments and undercount every
# limb. So contact is ENTERED at the tight margin and HELD until the looser one
# is crossed: the grip has to clearly break, not just graze the edge.
# Both are in units of FRAME HEIGHT, and isotropic: x is scaled by the aspect
# ratio before the test, so a margin means the same distance sideways as it does
# vertically. (Testing in raw normalized coordinates made every margin an
# ellipse — on this portrait clip, 1.78x more generous vertically.)

HOLD_BBOX_MARGIN = 0.018      # fallback for a hold with no usable mask

# How *close* a contact got, not just how long it lasted. The dwell above asks
# only how many frames a limb spent inside the margin, which a limb travelling
# past a hold at a constant distance satisfies as well as one resting on it: on
# IMG_8843 the left foot crossed hold 2's margin for exactly the dwell, never
# coming within 17px of the outline, and the hold activated.
#
# So a contact that never gets closer than GRAZE_DEPTH to the hold's edge is
# treated as a graze and has to last GRAZE_DWELL_SECONDS instead. Not rejected
# outright: depth alone does not separate them. The toe point is an estimate
# (ankle + ANKLE_TO_TOE_OFFSET, since COCO-17 has no foot), so a foot genuinely
# standing on a hold for seven seconds can sit a few pixels outside the mask the
# whole time — IMG_8845's left foot on hold 10 does. What the two real shallow
# contacts have that the grazes do not is duration.

# a row means.
#
#   "auto" — follow the route's own lean. A route running bottom-left to
